# ðŸ“Š Udemy Courses Analysis Project ðŸ“Š

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the extensive range of courses available on Udemy to extract valuable insights and provide a comprehensive analysis. As online learning platforms like Udemy continue to expand, understanding the trends, patterns, and characteristics of courses becomes essential for guiding both learners and instructors. ðŸ“ˆ


## Overview Dashboard


This project visualizes data to provide insights into how various countries have historically performed in terms of publishing courses on Udemy. As a data analyst at Udemy, I aim to address specific business questions through:

1. Cleaning data using a Kaggle notebook.
2. Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python.
3. Creating visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib.
4. Employing the Simple Imputer algorithm to predict missing values.

## Dataset

## EDA and Data Cleaning
The data cleaning and exploratory analysis process includes:

- Dropping unnecessary columns.
- Replacing missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Employing the Simple Imputer algorithm for missing values prediction.
- Identifying and handling outliers.
- Addressing key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Visualizing data to uncover patterns and insights.
- Data wrangling for optimization.
